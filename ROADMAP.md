# Simplified MVP Development Roadmap

This streamlined roadmap focuses on creating a functional MVP for the AI-Enhanced Resume Builder as a personal project. The goal is to achieve a working product with essential features in the shortest time possible.

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure (1 Week)

### Project Setup
- Set up a Vite React TypeScript project
- Configure styled-components and basic SCSS
- Create simple folder structure:
  - `src/components` - UI components
  - `src/pages` - Main application pages
  - `src/services` - API and utility functions
  - `src/types` - TypeScript interfaces
  - `src/styles` - Global styles and themes

### Core UI Development
- Create a simple, clean layout
- Implement a basic navigation system
- Build essential form components
- Set up a simple state management solution (React Context or Zustand)

## Phase 2: File Import and Resume Building (1-2 Weeks)

### Basic Profile Management
- Create a form for manual input of profile information
- Implement a simple JSON import function
- Add local storage to save user data
- Create a basic preview component

### Resume Template
- Develop one clean, professional resume template
- Implement basic styling options (fonts, colors, spacing)
- Create a preview system for the resume

## Phase 3: AI Integration (1 Week)

### OpenAI API Integration
- Create a simple serverless function for API communication
- Implement basic error handling and loading states
- Set up environment variables for API key storage

### Content Enhancement Features
- Implement job description input field
- Add a function to enhance resume bullet points based on job description
- Create a simple skill-matching visualization

## Phase 4: Cover Letter and Export (1 Week)

### Cover Letter Generation
- Build a simple cover letter template
- Add AI-powered content generation based on resume and job description
- Implement basic style options

### PDF Export
- Add a PDF generation function for both resume and cover letter
- Implement a simple file naming system
- Create download functionality

## Post-MVP Improvements

These features can be added incrementally after the MVP is working:

### Additional Templates
- Add 2-3 more resume styles
- Create additional cover letter formats

### Enhanced Import
- Add PDF parsing for resume import
- Improve data extraction logic

### UI Refinements
- Add a multi-step wizard interface
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add animations and transitions

### AI Enhancements
- Implement different tone options
- Add more specific content tailoring options
- Create a feedback loop for improving AI outputs

## Development Approach

For this personal project, follow these principles to maintain simplicity:

1. **Build sequentially**: Complete one feature before moving to the next
2. **Test manually**: Focus on functionality over automated testing
3. **Local-first**: Start with everything working locally before adding serverless functions
4. **Incremental complexity**: Begin with basic functionality, then enhance as needed
5. **Use existing libraries**: Leverage established tools rather than building custom solutions

## Simplified Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: styled-components + minimal SCSS
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand (simpler than Redux)
- **PDF Generation**: react-pdf or html2pdf
- **AI Integration**: Simple fetch calls to OpenAI API
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify for both frontend and serverless functions

## Development Milestones

1. **Working Layout**: Basic UI with form inputs and navigation (2-3 days)
2. **Data Management**: Profile storage and basic resume generation (3-4 days)
3. **AI Integration**: Working OpenAI integration for content enhancement (2-3 days)
4. **Complete Export**: Functioning PDF generation and download (2-3 days)

This simplified approach should allow you to create a working MVP in approximately 3-4 weeks of part-time development.
